# signtemplater
Tool to generate trail signs using templates.

This allows a user to create a sign template using SVG with Inkscape or other 
tools, then use a list of signs in a CSV file to generate a whole series of
signs which can then be printed.

This repository also includes the data used in the motivating project,
the Laguna Honda Community Trail System maintained by SF Urban Riders,
a park partner of the San Francisco Parks Alliance.
